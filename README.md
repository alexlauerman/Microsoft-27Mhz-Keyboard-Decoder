Microsoft-27Mhz-Keyboard-Decoder
================================

This uses python and GNURadio to remotely decode keystrokes.  Additional filtering and receiver amplification and gain tweaking would greatly improve the range and reliability to an estimated 100' using an omnidirectional antenna.  Keystrokes have been modified until I have another keyboard's data to segment out the keyboard ID's part of the signal.  Mouse data filtering/extraction has been removed.
